# Elliptic-Isogenies-PQC
This repository provides Python implementations of isogenies between elliptic curves, focusing on their role in post-quantum cryptography. It includes code for computing 2-isogenies and 3-isogenies, determining supersingular elliptic curve parameters, and constructing isogeny graphs.

Isogenies are essential in cryptographic protocols like SIDH (Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman) and SIKE, which aim to provide quantum-resistant key exchange. This repository offers efficient implementations using modular arithmetic, elliptic curve operations, and finite field computations.
